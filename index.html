    <h1>Good vs Bad Visualizations</h1>
    <h2 id="bad">Example of a Poor Visualization</h2>
        <div id="float"><p>Unlike Cairo's idea that visualizations be aesethically pleasing and beautiful, this chart immediately overwhelms the viewer with the length of its title. Additionally, it represents a range of countries, but the exact percentages from each country are unclear. Furthermore, the data was collected during various years and leads to inconsistent data representation. While the color contrast between the different providers is nice, the chart proves to be an inefficient use of a visual.</p>
        <br /> 
            <p>In order to improve this chart in accordance to Cairo's qualities of a good visual, I would recommend creating separate charts for each of the countries. Additionally, it would be nice to clarify what defines a person as "poor" vs "nonpoor." Additionally, the chart should have a more concise title to make it easier for the viewer to know what it is about. </p></div>

        <p id="dead">This graph is an example of a good visualization because it is truthful, functional, insightful, beautiful, and enlightening. It is easy to read as it provides a map along with the names of the countries and their respective percentages. Additionally, it is from a specific date and provides quality and valid information about internet usage around the world. So, not only is it aesethically pleasing, but it also provides information to a view a quick and concise manner.</p>
